                if you're reading this, then you want a more personal look into my relationship with work, so let me start, I'm the guy who made this page, very passionate about making money and not being poor. I believe, in my heart of hearts, that my job is to get paid, and i get paid by automating something or making a task more convenient for you. Amma be honest with you, i have no idea who you are, and you don't know who i am, but one thing you can be sure of is that i want your money, and to get that sweet sweet bread i need to make whatever it is you want. So you can be sure that not only will i do my absolute best for you, I'll also do it as fast as i possibly can! Not because of something as vague as a "work ethic", but because i don't get paid until after you're satisfied with the results. If you read the professional version of this page that reads like a robot trying to sound like half-dead human, then you'd have seen the part about solving real problems for people or whatever it was i wrote. The truth is I only solve one problem and for one person here, me, and the problem I solve is having no money. When am not busy hustling and making my bank account number go up, I'm usually enjoying my time, turns out just chilling and being able to do what you reasonably want is great for the mind! who would've thought! Where was i going with this, right this is the personal page, as in no corporate language or etiquette, just me and this keyboard.

                    <ul class="achievement-list">
                        <li>I really did all i said i did, the only reason i didn't lie is cause you need to show your previous projects to any future employer, which is not ideal when you lie about said previous projects. Right, other achievements, i once had a manager who could not articulate a thought if it hit them in the face, just a tragic case of no brain disease, this wonderful individual with the IQ of a coffee table personally raised my blood pressure by 2 degrees of magnitude, such kindness. But working with this mouth-breather did teach me to not curse them out and/or hit them with a chair, a rather tempting idea at the time, still is to be honest. I put this in the key achievements section cause i consider my consistent restrain to not cancel their subscription to life by strangelation a far more challenging task than making literally any app.</li>
                        <li>Achievement 2 is adapting to utterly nonsensical and batshit stupid requests. Same lobotomized manager, thought it was the height of intelligence to tell me to make changes to my database on day 6 of making that management system, day 6! I'm deeper in this project than he's ever been with a woman and he says that! I had already made the relationships and pages and everything, and this genius of a specimen decides to introduce changes to the guts of my goddamn code at this particular moment, it wasn't even surface level, this raccoon on meth decided to change the fields of the database! I swear if the consequence wasn't jail and not getting paid i would've hit the ameba with the nearest chair. but i didn't because of key achievement N°1, restraint, told you it was more important than technical skills</li>

                        <li>Skill N°1 :I can make you a desktop or web app with whatever specifications you need, there's no core skills here, i do what i need to complete the job</li>
                        <li>Skill N°2 :Restraint and patience</li>
                        <li>Skill N°3 and arguably the second most important one, making money, cannot overstate how important this skill is to my personal skill list, it defines my work philosophy, which boils down to make money.</li>

                        <li>If you choose to contact me through the professional page, i will be just as professional and fake polite as you'd expect, if you contact me through the personal page, I'll talk to you like a coworker would, one with an actual IQ above room temperture, just straight to the point and do my best to make sure you get what you want and be satisfied with it so i can get paid, expect "bad" language, i would remove it but that would defeat the whole point of the personal side, and to be honest it's so descriptive, there's such a difference between calling someone an idiot and calling them fucking stupid, you see what i mean? anyway you choose, either way amma do my best and you're getting your product.</li>
